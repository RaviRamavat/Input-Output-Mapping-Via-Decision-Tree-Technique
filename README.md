# Input-Output Mapping via Decision Tree Technique

## Description

### The project focuses on solving the problem of Input-Output Mapping using a Decision Tree Technique. Given an input sequence and the corresponding output sequence, the goal is to generate a logic circuit that matches the input-output relations.

### Using Decision Trees, the project builds a circuit that can predict the output for any given input with high accuracy. The accuracy is verified by testing the circuit with a care setâ€”a hidden testing input-output dataset that is used to evaluate the performance of the generated logic circuit.
