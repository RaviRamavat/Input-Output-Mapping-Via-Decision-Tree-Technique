# Input-Output-Mapping-Via-Decision-Tree-Technique

## Description

### The project topic is “Input-Output Mapping via Decision Tree Technique”. If we are given an input sequence and an output sequence corresponding to it, we need to find the logic circuit which matches the input-output relations.This is done using Decision Trees. With the help of Decision tree We are generating the circuit which can predict output of given input with high accuracy in the care set.The care set is hidden testing input-output data to test the performance of the circuit.
